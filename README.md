# TestAPILaravel
test for an exercice (laravel + react) to test some simple API, SQL file is the Trigger
TestAPI is for testing API, so we can find in it a react project, use npm start to launch the website (you need to launch first )
The other file is the laravel API (not working idk why, but all the logic is here ) 
A trigger file .SQL is here for the trigger to use it in database
